# Secure Nodes

![Secure Nodes](securenodes.jpg)

Secure Nodes is committed to the recovery and future success of the Luna Classic chain. 

We value commitment, scalability, and development, while prioritizing safety, sustainability, and the reduction in supply of Luna Classic and USTC.

Our investors may earn the highest rewards by auto-compounding, while also staking with a node that provides increased availability, security, and uptime.

## Goal:

Our mission is to work with builders, developers, validators, and community members to help the Terra Classic ecosystem recover. 

Our priorities are the following:

* Development
* Utility
* Reduction in Supply

We look forward to working with others to accomplish our goals, which we share with so many.

## Who we are:

The Secure Nodes team consists of three core community members that have been involved with Luna Classic since the very beginning. We have been involved with many key proposals, including Proposal 11660, Proposal 11947, and Proposal 12033.

We are also co-founders and admins of two of the most important community hubs in the Luna Classic community; the “LUNC United” and “Luna Classic Community” telegram pages. You will also find us engaging with community members and other Validators on Discord and X.

We believe that engaging with the community, development teams, Validators, and outside projects, is the best path forward. Together, our shared goals and commitments can make our shared vision a new reality.
